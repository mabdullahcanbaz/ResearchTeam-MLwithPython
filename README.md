# ResearchTeam-MLwithPython

This is the Respository we will be posting our study notes, ppts, code, and other excersises. Stay tuned!


 

This semester. Spring 2022, I plan to go over with you some basic concepts on Machine Learning and Python. We will be following the book (PDF) below. Each week, I would like one of you to present a chapter and the rest of us to explore and find examples that will solidify the knowledge. This will be a group study with hands-on examples.

 

I need you, the presenters, to prepare a presentation about the chapter and the rest of the team to find valuable examples and add them to a GitHub Project.

 

Please create a Github account (if you do not have one yet) and send me your usernames so I can invite you to the project.

Thanks.
